                <p>Following a triumphant campaign in 2014, Narendra Modi—presenting himself as a practical leader—was named prime minister of India. Prioritizing economic changes, his administration relaxed restrictions on foreign investment and concentrated on improving transportation infrastructure. By welcoming Chinese President Xi Jinping and holding a fruitful meeting with US President Barack Obama, Modi accomplished diplomatic victories. While serving as prime minister, Modi advanced Hindu culture and carried out important economic reforms, like as the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and demonetization. The reforms broadened the tax base even as GDP growth slowed and unemployment rose, falling short of the public's hopes for economic expansion.

Jawaharlal Nehru stated that the Assembly's main objective was to deal with India's urgent concerns, such as hunger and poverty, and that these issues needed to be resolved quickly in order for the constitutional efforts to have any significance.

Even though the INC's vote share dropped from 48% to 45%, it was still the overwhelming force. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru served in that capacity till his passing in 1964. Subsequently, Gulzarilal Nanda assumed the role of acting prime minister until Lal Bahadur Shastri, who remained in that position for 19 months until his death. Following Nehru's tenure, Indira Gandhi took over the position in 1966, signaling a change in Indian leadership.

                    With around 250 million voters casting ballots, Indira Gandhi's Congress party won 283 of 520 seats, guaranteeing her party's fourth term in office. The Congress's vote share dropped to about 41% even after winning. Interestingly, six other parties secured ten or more seats; the largest opposition party was C. Rajagopalachari's Swatantra Party, which secured 44 seats. As the electoral landscape changed, Indira Gandhi cemented her political position by assuming the prime ministership twice.

                    After Indira Gandhi broke away from the Congress, her party won an astounding 352 seats out of 518 in the first election, while the Morarji Desai fraction only managed 16 seats. For the third time, Indira Gandhi took on the position of prime minister. During the time that began with her triumph in 1975, India was placed under a state of emergency, which had a profound impact on the political climate of the nation in the years that followed. Indian politics were significantly impacted by the emergency phase, which had a long-lasting effect on the country's political development.

                    The Bharatiya Lok Dal (BLD), which subsequently became a component of the Janata Party, earned a historic victory in the post-emergency elections, which was the first time the Congress was beaten. The BLD, which was founded in 1974 by uniting seven groups that opposed Indira Gandhi's dictatorial leadership, teamed up with the Jan Sangh and Indian National Congress (Organization) to run as the Janata Party in the 1977 elections. The Janata Party established India's first non-Congress administration by winning 295 of 542 seats. After the Janata alliance parties withdrew their support, Morarji Desai was appointed prime minister and was succeeded in 1979 by Charan Singh.

                    After the Janata experiment failed, Indira Gandhi's Congress (I) triumphantly reclaimed power by winning 353 of the 529 seats that were up for grabs. The parties from the erstwhile Janata coalition were unable to repeat their prior achievements. Notably, during this time there was no designated Leader of Opposition (LoP). After the difficulties of the post-emergency and Janata Party eras, Indira Gandhi's decisive win signaled a dramatic political turnabout for Congress (I).

                    Anti-Sikh riots broke out in India after Indira Gandhi was killed in 1984, and Sikhs were targeted in pogroms in retaliation. The Congress party, led by Rajiv Gandhi, the son of Indira, took advantage of the sympathy wave to win 404 out of 514 seats, securing a landslide victory. In its first elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won two seats in Andhra Pradesh (now Telangana) and Gujarat. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi took over the position. The terrible circumstances surrounding Indira Gandhi's murder and the ensuing anti-Sikh riots overshadowed the election.

                    The Congress suffered setbacks amid the Bofors scandal, LTTE concerns, and other issues. A hung parliament—the first in Indian history—was the outcome of the election, with no party winning a majority. Out of 529 seats, the Congress won 197, the Janata Dal won 143, and the BJP won 85. The BJP achieved notable victories. With the backing of the BJP and left parties, the Janata Dal led the National Front administration. The prime minister is now Vishwanath Pratap Singh, also known as VP Singh. In 1990, Chandra Shekhar broke away from the party due to internal issues and founded the Samajwadi Janata Party. With the help of the Congress, Chandra Shekhar took over after Vice President Singh resigned. However, this arrangement was not long-lasting, since new elections were held within two years.

                    The Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid controversy and the OBC reservation proposed by the Mandal Commission were the two main causes of Rajiv Gandhi's assassination during the 1991 general elections, sometimes referred to as the "Mandal-Mandir" elections. OBCs were given a 27% reservation in government posts by the Mandal Commission, which was put into place by the VP Singh administration. The contentious Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was at the center of the Mandir controversy. Following the riots, there was division along caste and religious lines. There was no majority party; the Congress got 232 seats and the BJP 120 out of 521. After forming a minority administration led by P V Narasimha Rao, Manmohan Singh was chosen to lead the economy and eventually become prime minister.

Congress gave the Janata Dal-led "United Front" outside backing but declined to form the government. After taking office unannounced, H. D. Deve Gowda led the country for eighteen months before resigning. I. K. Gujral briefly replaced him but faced opposition from the Janata Dal.

For the third time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee assumed the role of prime minister. Following the Kargil battle, there was a surge in nationalistic feelings leading up to the election, which helped the BJP win a majority and build a strong coalition government.

                    In the 2004 elections, the BJP, promoting the 'India Shining' campaign, aimed for early polls. While securing the middle-class vote, the Congress and regional parties gained support from the poorer sections, leading to the NDA's defeat. The BJP won 138 seats, Congress improved to 145, and regional parties secured 159. Conceding defeat, the BJP allowed the Congress to form the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) with external support from the left parties. Amidst controversy over her foreign origin, Sonia Gandhi declined the Prime Ministership, leading to Manmohan Singh's appointment as the Prime Minister.

Compared to 2004, the Congress won 206 seats, a considerable increase, while the BJP got just 116. 146 seats were claimed by regional parties. With this win, the UPA was sworn in for a second consecutive term as prime minister, with Manmohan Singh taking the oath of office.

                    Corruption claims and controversies, including those involving 2G, Coal Block, Adarsh, and the Commonwealth Games, dogged the UPA's second term. The situation was made worse by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's perceived lack of authority and his quiet. Rahul Gandhi was successfully eclipsed by the BJP's portrayal of Narendra Modi as their prime ministerial candidate. With 282 seats, the BJP easily won a majority in the 2014 elections, while the Congress had its worst-ever showing with just 44 seats. This was the first time a party had achieved a majority on its own since 1984.

                    The BJP gained a larger mandate by riding the wave of nationalism, popular policies, and the lack of a rival leader to Narendra Modi. With the support of the NDA, the BJP led by Narendra Modi crossed the 350-seat threshold after winning 303 seats on its own. Only Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi had ever secured a single-party majority in India's history until Modi's remarkable achievement of doing so for a second term in a row. With just 52 seats won, including a loss in Amethi for Congress President Rahul Gandhi, the Congress suffered yet another setback.
