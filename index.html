                    <div class="debate-img-red-space">The political landscape is changing ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections, as leaders are changing alliances and parties. The importance of ideological orientation is growing, according to political scientist Praveen Rai, who divides it into three categories: left, right, and centrist. He observes that it affects how people vote. Another expert, Chandan Gowda, believes that ideology is significant but not crucial. He stresses the importance of having an inspiring vision that the public can relate to. The shifting coalitions and ideological factors add a dynamic element to the Congress and INDIA bloc's efforts to oppose the BJP, hence influencing the political environment.

The strong economy has brought in a windfall for taxes, which has helped the government reach its deficit reduction goals. In her sixth budget statement on February 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is predicted to maintain infrastructure expenditure and roll out specific projects for Modi's main political constituencies, which are women, young people, farmers, and the impoverished. Economists predict a modest budget despite the economic growth, viewing it as a stopgap measure until the next administration takes office.</div>
